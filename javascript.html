<h2>Comment your JavaScript Code </h2>
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.<br>

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:<br>

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:<br>

<pre>
	// This is an in-line comment.<br>
</pre>
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */:<br>

<pre>
/* This is a <br>
   multi-line comment */<br>	
</pre>
Best Practice<br>
As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.<br>

Instructions<br>
Try creating one of each type of comment.			<br>

<h2>Declare JavaScript Variables</h2>
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.<br>

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.<br>

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.<br>

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.<br>

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:<br>

<pre>
	var ourName;<br>
</pre>
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.<br>

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number. <br>

Instructions<br>
Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.<br>

Hint<br>
Look at the ourName example if you get stuck.		<br>	
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
<h2>Storing Values with the Assignment Operator </h2>
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.<br>	

myVariable = 5;<br>	

Assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.<br>	

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.<br>	

<pre>
myVar = 5;<br>	
myNum = myVar;<br>		
</pre>
Assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Assign the value 7 to variable a.<br>	

Assign the contents of a to variable b.			<br>	
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
<h2>Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator </h2>
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.<br>	

<pre>var myVar = 0;<br>	</pre>

Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.			<br>	
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
<h2>Understanding Uninitialized Variables </h2>
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.			<br>	
		</p>
		<hr>
<p>
<h2>Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables </h2>
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.<br>	

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.<br>	

Best Practice<br>	
Write variable names in Javascript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.<br>	

Examples:<br>	

<pre>
var someVariable;<br>	
var anotherVariableName;<br>	
var thisVariableNameIsTooLong;<br>		
</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.<br>	
Do not create any new variables.	<br>	
</p>		
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Add Two Numbers with JavaScript </h2>
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.<br>	

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.<br>	

JavaScript uses the + symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>
	myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15<br>	
</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript </h2>
We can also subtract one number from another.<br>	

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6<br>	</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Change the 0 so the difference is 12.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript </h2>
We can also multiply one number by another.<br>	

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169<br>	</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript</h2> 
We can also divide one number by another.<br>	

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8<br>	</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2 id="h2-1">Increment a Number with JavaScript </h2>
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.<br>	

i++;<br>	

is the equivalent of<br>	

i = i + 1;<br>	

Note<br>	
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.<br>	

Hint<br>	
Learn more about Arithmetic operators - Increment (++).<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Decrement a Number with JavaScript </h2>
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.<br>	

i--;<br>	

is the equivalent of<br>	

i = i - 1;<br>	

Note<br>	
The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript </h2>
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.<br>	

Note<br>	
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript </h2>
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.<br>	

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript </h2>
We can also divide one number by another.<br>	

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8<br>	</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Increment a Number with JavaScript </h2>
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.<br>	

i++;<br>	

is the equivalent of<br>	

i = i + 1;<br>	

Note<br>	
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.<br>	

Hint<br>	
Learn more about Arithmetic operators - Increment (++).	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Finding a Remainder in JavaScript </h2>
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>
	5 % 2 = 1 because<br>	
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)<br>	
2 * 2 = 4<br>	
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)<br>	
</pre>
Usage<br>	
In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.<br>	

<pre>
	17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)<br>	
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)<br>	
</pre>
Note<br>	
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition </h2>
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:<br>	

myVar = myVar + 5;<br>	

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.<br>	

One such operator is the += operator.<br>	

myVar += 5; will add 5 to myVar.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction</h2>	
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.<br>	

myVar = myVar - 5;<br>	

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:<br>	

myVar -= 5;<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication </h2>
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.<br>	

myVar = myVar * 5;<br>	

will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:<br>	

myVar *= 5;<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Compound Assignment With Augmented Division </h2>
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.<br>	

myVar = myVar / 5;<br>	

Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:<br>	

myVar /= 5;<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit </h2>
To test your learning, you will create a solution "from scratch". Place your code between the indicated lines and it will be tested against multiple test cases.<br>	

The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.<br>	

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and apply the algorithm to assign it the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit.<br>	

Note<br>	
Don't worry too much about the function and return statements as they will be covered in future challenges. For now, only use operators that you have already learned.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Declare String Variables </h2>
Previously we have used the code<br>	

var myName = "your name";<br>	

"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings </h2>
When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?<br>	

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.<br>	

var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";<br>	

This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:<br>	

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:<br>	

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2></h2>
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, so long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some languages, single and double quotes are functionally identical in JavaScript.<br>	

"This string has \"double quotes\" in it"<br>	

The value in using one or the other has to do with the need to escape quotes of the same type. Unless they are escaped, you cannot have more than one pair of whichever quote type begins a string.<br>	

If you have a string with many double quotes, this can be difficult to read and write. Instead, use single quotes:<br>	

'This string has "double quotes" in it. And "probably" lots of them.'<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Change the provided string from double to single quotes and remove the escaping.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Escape Sequences in Strings </h2>
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Here is a table of common escape sequences:<br>	

Code	Output<br>	
\'	single quote<br>	
\"	double quote<br>	
\\	backslash<br>	
\n	newline<br>	
\r	carriage return<br>	
\t	tab<br>	
\b	backspace<br>	
\f	form feed<br>	
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.<br>	

FirstLine<br>	
\SecondLine\<br>	
ThirdLine<br>	
You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.<br>	

Here is the text with the escape sequences written out.<br>	

FirstLinenewlinebackslashSecondLinebackslashcarriage-returnThirdLine	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator </h2>
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'<br>	</pre>
Note<br>	
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator </h2>
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.<br>	

Note<br>	
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings:<br>	
"This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Constructing Strings with Variables </h2>
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am swell!"<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Appending Variables to Strings </h2>
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Find the Length of a String </h2>
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.<br>	

"Alan Peter".length; // 10<br>	

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String </h2>
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.<br>	

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.<br>	

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.<br>	

Hint<br>	
Try looking at the firstLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Understand String Immutability </h2>
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.<br>	

For example, the following code:<br>	

<pre>
	var myStr = "Bob";<br>	
myStr[0] = "J";<br>	
</pre>
cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:<br>	

<pre>
	var myStr = "Bob";<br>	
myStr = "Job";<br>	
</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Correct the assignment to myStr to achieve the desired effect.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String </h2>
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.<br>	

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.<br>	

Hint<br>	
Try looking at the secondLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String </h2>
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.<br>	

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.<br>	

Hint<br>	
Try looking at the lastLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Use Bracket Notation to Find the NthtoLast Character in a String </h2>
You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.<br>	

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.<br>	

Hint<br>	
Try looking at the thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Word Blanks </h2>
We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "Mad Libs" style word game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.<br>	

In a "Mad Libs" game, you are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.<br>	

Consider this sentence - "It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____". This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:<br>	

var sentence = "It was really" + "hot" + ", and we" + "laughed" + "ourselves" + "silly.";
In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.<br>	

You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the result variable.<br>	

You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays </h2>
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.<br>	

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:<br>	

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).<br>	

Hint<br>	
Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Nest one Array within Another Array </h2>
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like this: [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]. This is also called a Multi-dimensional Array.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Create a nested array called myArray.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Access Array Data with Indexes </h2>
We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.<br>	

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array is element 0.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>
	var array = [1,2,3];<br>	
array[0]; // equals 1<br>	
var data = array[1];  // equals 2<br>	
</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Modify Array Data With Indexes </h2>
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>
	var ourArray = [3,2,1];<br>	
ourArray[0] = 1; // equals [1,2,1]<br>	
</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 3.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Access MultiDimensional Arrays With Indexes </h2>
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>
var arr = [<br>	
    [1,2,3],<br>	
    [4,5,6],<br>	
    [7,8,9],<br>	
    [[10,11,12], 13, 14]<br>	
];<br>	
arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]<br>	
arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]<br>	
arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11<br>		
</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Manipulate Arrays With push </h2>
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.<br>	

.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.<br>	

<pre>
var arr = [1,2,3];<br>	
arr.push(4);<br>	
// arr is now [1,2,3,4]<br>		
</pre>
Instructions<br>	
Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Manipulate Arrays With pop </h2>
Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.<br>	

.pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable.<br>	

Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.<br>	

For example, for the code<br>	
var oneDown = [1, 4, 6].pop();<br>	
the variable oneDown now holds the value 6 and the array becomes [1, 4].<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Use the .pop() function to remove the last item from myArray, assigning the "popped off" value to removedFromMyArray.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Manipulate Arrays With shift </h2>
pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?<br>	

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray, assigning the "shifted off" value to removedFromMyArray.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Manipulate Arrays With unshift </h2>
Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.<br>	

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Add ["Paul",35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift().	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Shopping List </h2>
Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.<br>	

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.<br>	

["Chocolate Bar", 15]<br>	

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.<br>	
</p>

<p>
	<h2>Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions </h2>
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.<br>	

Here's an example of a function:<br>	

<pre>
	function functionName() {<br>	
  console.log("Hello World");<br>	
}<br>	
</pre>
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this:<br>	

functionName();
<br>	
Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Create a function called reusableFunction which prints "Hi World" to the dev console.<br>	
Call the function.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Passing Values to Functions with Arguments </h2>
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.<br>	

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:<br>	

<pre>
	function testFun(param1, param2) {<br>	
  console.log(param1, param2);<br>	
}<br>	
</pre>
Then we can call testFun:<br>	

testFun("Hello", "World");<br>	

We have passed two arguments, "Hello" and "World". Inside the function, param1 will equal "Hello" and param2 will equal "World". Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.<br>	
Call the function.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Global Scope and Functions </h2>
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.<br>	

Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Using var, declare a global variable myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.<br>	

Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var keyword.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Local Scope and Functions </h2>
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.<br>	

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.<br>	

<pre>
function myTest() {<br>	
  var loc = "foo";<br>	
  console.log(loc);<br>	
}<br>	
myTest(); // "foo"<br>	
console.log(loc); // "undefined"<br>		
</pre>
loc is not defined outside of the function.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope. Run the tests and then follow the instructions commented out in the editor.<br>	

Hint<br>	
Refreshing the page may help if you get stuck.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Global vs Local Scope in Functions </h2>
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.<br>	

In this example:<br>	

<pre>
var someVar = "Hat";<br>	
function myFun() {<br>	
  var someVar = "Head";<br>	
  return someVar;<br>	
}<br>		
</pre>
The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Add a local variable to myOutfit to override the value of outerWear with "sweater".<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Return a Value from a Function with Return </h2>
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.<br>	

Example<br>	

<pre>
function plusThree(num) {<br>	
  return num + 3;<br>	
}<br>	
var answer = plusThree(5); // 8<br>		
</pre>
plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Assignment with a Returned Value </h2>
If you'll recall from our discussion of Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.<br>	

Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:<br>	

ourSum = sum(5, 12);<br>	

will call sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to ourSum variable.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.	<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Stand in Line </h2>
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.<br>	

Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments. Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of array. The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.<br>	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Understanding Boolean Values </h2>
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.<br>	

Note<br>	
Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.<br>	

Instructions<br>	
Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.<br>		
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Use Conditional Logic with If Statements </h2>
If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions because they may only be true or false.<br>		

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.<br>		

Pseudocode<br>		

<pre>
if (condition is true) {<br>		
statement is executed<br>		
}<br>		
</pre>
Example<br>		

<pre>
function test (myCondition) {<br>		
  if (myCondition) {<br>		
     return "It was true";<br>		
  }<br>		
  return "It was false";<br>		
}<br>		
test(true);  // returns "It was true"<br>		
test(false); // returns "It was false"<br>			
</pre>
When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns "It was true". When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns "It was false".<br>		

Instructions<br>		
Create an if statement inside the function to return "Yes, that was true" if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return "No, that was false" otherwise.<br>		
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparison with the Equality Operator </h2>
There are many Comparison Operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.<br>			

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.<br>			

<pre>
function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
     return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}	
</pre>
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return "Equal". Otherwise, the function will return "Not Equal".<br>			

In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:<br>			

<pre>
   1   ==  1    // true
   1   ==  2    // false
   1   == '1'   // true
  "3"  ==  3    // true	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return "Equal" when val is equivalent to 12	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator </h2>
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). Unlike the equality operator, strict equality tests both the data type and value of the compared elements.<br>			

Examples<br>			

<pre>
3 === 3   // true
3 === '3' // false	
</pre>
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.<br>			

Instructions<br>			
Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return "Equal" when val is strictly equal to 7<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparison with the Inequality Operator </h2>
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.<br>			

Examples<br>			

<pre>
1 != 2      // true
1 != "1"    // false
1 != '1'    // false
1 != true   // false
0 != false  // false	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Add the inequality operator != in the if statement so that the function will return "Not Equal" when val is not equivalent to 99	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator </h2>
The strict inequality operator (!==) is the opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.<br>			

Examples<br>			

<pre>
3 !== 3   // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !== 3   // true	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Add the strict inequality operator to the if statement so the function will return "Not Equal" when val is not strictly equal to 17	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparison with the Greater Than Operator </h2>
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.<br>			

Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.<br>			

Examples<br>			

<pre>
 5 > 3   // true
 7 > '3' // true
 2 > 3   // false
'1' > 9  // false	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Add the greater than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator </h2>
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.<br>			

Like the equality operator, greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.<br>			

Examples<br>			

<pre>
 6  >=  6  // true
 7  >= '3' // true
 2  >=  3  // false
'7' >=  9  // false	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparison with the Less Than Operator </h2>
The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.<br>			

Examples<br>			

<pre>
  2 < 5  // true
'3' < 7  // true
  5 < 5  // false
  3 < 2  // false
'8' < 4  // false	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Add the less than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator </h2>
The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than or equal to converts data types.<br>			

Examples<br>			

<pre>
  4 <= 5  // true
'7' <= 7  // true
  5 <= 5  // true
  3 <= 2  // false
'8' <= 4  // false	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Add the less than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparisons with the Logical And Operator </h2>
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.<br>			

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:<br>			

<pre>
if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";	
</pre>
will only return "Yes" if num is between 6 and 9 (6 and 9 included). The same logic can be written as:<br>			

<pre>
if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Combine the two if statements into one statement which will return "Yes" if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25. Otherwise, will return "No".	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator </h2>
The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.<br>			

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:<br>			

<pre>
if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";	
</pre>
will return "Yes" only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:<br>			

<pre>
if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Combine the two if statements into one statement which returns "Outside" if val is not between 10 and 20, inclusive. Otherwise, return "Inside".	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Introducing Else Statements </h2>
When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.<br>			

<pre>
if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement.	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Introducing Else If Statements </h2>
If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.<br>			

<pre>
if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Convert the logic to use else if statements.	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Logical Order in If Else Statements </h2>
Order is important in if, else if statements.<br>			

The loop is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.<br>			

Take these two functions as an example.<br>			

Here's the first:<br>			

<pre>
function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}	
</pre>
And the second just switches the order of the statements:<br>			

<pre>
function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}	
</pre>
While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.<br>			

<pre>
foo(0) // "Less than one"
bar(0) // "Less than two"	
</pre>
Instructions
Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct statements in all cases.	<br>			
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Chaining If Else Statements </h2>
if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic. Here is pseudocode of multiple chained if / else if statements:<br>			
<pre>

if (condition1) {
  statement1
} else if (condition2) {
  statement2
} else if (condition3) {
  statement3
. . .
} else {
  statementN
}	
</pre>
Instructions<br>			
Write chained if/else if statements to fulfill the following conditions:<br>			

num < 5 - return "Tiny"<br>			
num < 10 - return "Small"<br>			
num < 15 - return "Medium"<br>			
num < 20 - return "Large"<br>			
num >= 20 - return "Huge"	<br>			
</p>	
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Golf Code </h2>
In the game of golf each hole has a par meaning the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in a hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.<br>			

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):<br>			

Strokes	Return<br>			
1	"Hole-in-one!"<br>			
<= par - 2	"Eagle"<br>			
par - 1	"Birdie"<br>			
par	"Par"<br>			
par + 1	"Bogey"<br>			
par + 2	"Double Bogey"<br>			
>= par + 3	"Go Home!"<br>			
par and strokes will always be numeric and positive.<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Selecting from many options with Switch Statements </h2>
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which defines various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.<br>				

Here is a pseudocode example:<br>				

<pre>
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
}	
</pre>
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:<br>				
1 - "alpha"<br>				
2 - "beta"<br>				
3 - "gamma"<br>				
4 - "delta"<br>				

Here are some helpful links:<br>				

Switch Statement	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Adding a default option in Switch statements </h2>
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.<br>				

A default statement should be the last case.<br>				

<pre>
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
}	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Write a switch statement to set answer for the following conditions:<br>				
"a" - "apple"<br>				
"b" - "bird"<br>				
"c" - "cat"<br>				
default - "stuff"	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements </h2>
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:<br>				

<pre>
switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}	
</pre>
Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Write a switch statement to set answer for the following ranges:<br>				
1-3 - "Low"<br>				
4-6 - "Mid"<br>				
7-9 - "High"<br>				

Note<br>				
You will need to have a case statement for each number in the range.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Replacing If Else Chains with Switch </h2>
If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:<br>				

<pre>
if (val === 1) {
  answer = "a";
} else if (val === 2) {
  answer = "b";
} else {
  answer = "c";
}	
</pre>
can be replaced with:<br>				

<pre>
switch (val) {
  case 1:
    answer = "a";
    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "b";
    break;
  default:
    answer = "c";
}	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Change the chained if/else if statements into a switch statement.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Returning Boolean Values from Functions </h2>
You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.<br>				

A common anti-pattern is to use an if/else statement to do a comparison and then return true/false:
<br>				
<pre>
function isEqual(a,b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}	
</pre>
Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:<br>				

<pre>
function isEqual(a,b) {
  return a === b;
}	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Fix the function isLess to remove the if/else statements.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Return Early Pattern for Functions </h2>
When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.<br>				

Example<br>				

<pre>
function myFun() {
  console.log("Hello");
  return "World";
  console.log("byebye")
}
myFun();	
</pre>
The above outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Modify the function abTest so that if a or b are less than 0 the function will immediately exit with a value of undefined.<br>				

Hint<br>				
Remember that undefined is a keyword, not a string.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Counting Cards </h2>
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.<br>				

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.<br>				

Count Change	Cards<br>				
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6<br>				
0	7, 8, 9<br>				
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'<br>				
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string "Bet" if the count is positive, or "Hold" if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision ("Bet" or "Hold") should be separated by a single space.<br>				
<br>				
Example Output<br>				
"-3 Hold"<br>				
"5 Bet"
<br>				
Hint<br>				
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Build JavaScript Objects </h2>
You may have heard the term object before.<br>				

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.<br>				

Here's a sample object:<br>				

<pre>
var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};	
</pre>
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs", "tails" and "friends".<br>				

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Accessing Objects Properties with the Dot Operator </h2>
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: the dot operator (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.<br>				

The dot operator is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.<br>				

Here is a sample of using the dot operator (.) to read an object property:<br>				

<pre>
var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object property shirt.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Accessing Objects Properties with Bracket Notation </h2>
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in it, you will need to use bracket notation.<br>				

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object property:<br>				

var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Accessing Objects Properties with Variables </h2>
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to use a variable to access a property. This can be very useful for iterating through lists of the object properties or for doing the lookup.<br>				

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:<br>				

<pre>
var someProp = "propName";
var myObj = {
  propName: "Some Value"
}
myObj[someProp]; // "Some Value"	
</pre>
Here is one more:<br>				

<pre>
var myDog = "Hunter";
var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
}
var breed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(breed);// "Doberman"	
</pre>
Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Use the playerNumber variable to lookup player 16 in testObj using bracket notation.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Updating Object Properties </h2>
After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.<br>				

For example, let's look at ourDog:<br>				

<pre>
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};	
</pre>
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to "Happy Camper". Here's how we update his object's name property:<br>				

ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or<br>				

ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper";<br>				

Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper".<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from "Coder" to "Happy Coder". You can use either dot or bracket notation.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object </h2>
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.<br>				

Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:<br>				

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";<br>				

or<br>				

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";<br>				

Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Add a "bark" property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation.	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object </h2>
We can also delete properties from objects like this:<br>				

delete ourDog.bark;<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Delete the "tails" property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Using Objects for Lookups </h2>
Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.<br>				

Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:<br>				

<pre>
var alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  ...
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};
alpha[2]; // "Y"
alpha[24]; // "C"

var value = 2;
alpha[value]; // "Y"	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Convert the switch statement into a lookup table called lookup. Use it to lookup val and assign the associated string to the result variable.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Testing Objects for Properties </h2>
Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.<br>				

Example<br>				

<pre>
var myObj = {
  top: "hat",
  bottom: "pants"
};
myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");    // true
myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle"); // false	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Modify the function checkObj to test myObj for checkProp. If the property is found, return that property's value. If not, return "Not Found".<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Manipulating Complex Objects </h2>
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.<br>				

Here's an example of a complex data structure:<br>				

<pre>
var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  }
];	
</pre>
This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested "formats" array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array.<br>				

Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a value of "Daft Punk".<br>				

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used to store data.<br>				

<pre>
{
  "artist": "Daft Punk",
  "title": "Homework",
  "release_year": 1997,
  "formats": [ 
    "CD",
    "Cassette",
    "LP"
  ],
  "gold": true
}	
</pre>
Note<br>				
You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Add a new album to the myMusic array. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Accessing Nested Objects </h2>
The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.<br>				

Here is a nested object:<br>				

<pre>
var ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;  // "secrets"
ourStorage.desk.drawer; // "stapler"	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use bracket notation for properties with a space in their name.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Accessing Nested Arrays </h2>
As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, Array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.<br>				

Here is an example of how to access a nested array:<br>				

<pre>
var ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer",
      "Fluffy",
      "Kit-Cat"
    ]
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"
    ]
  }
];
ourPets[0].names[1]; // "Fluffy"
ourPets[1].names[0]; // "Spot"	
</pre>
Instructions<br>				
Retrieve the second tree from the variable myPlants using object dot and array bracket notation.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Iterate with JavaScript For Loops </h2>
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.<br>				

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a "for loop" because it runs "for" a specific number of times.<br>				

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:<br>				

for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])<br>				

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.<br>				

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.<br>				

The final-expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.<br>				

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final-expression.<br>				

<pre>
var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}	
</pre>
ourArray will now contain [0,1,2,3,4].<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Use a for loop to work to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop </h2>
For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.<br>				

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.<br>				

<pre>
var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}	
</pre>
ourArray will now contain [0,2,4,6,8].<br>				

Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Count Backwards With a For Loop </h2>
A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.<br>				

In order to count backwards by twos, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final-expression.<br>				

We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2. <br>				

<pre>
var ourArray = [];
for (var i=10; i > 0; i-=2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}	
</pre>
ourArray will now contain [10,8,6,4,2].<br>				

Let's change our initialization and final-expression so we can count backward by twos by odd numbers.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop </h2>
A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:<br>				

<pre>
var arr = [10,9,8,7,6];
for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}	
</pre>
Remember that Arrays have zero-based numbering, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops when i is at length - 1.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Declare and initialize a variable total to 0. Use a for loop to add the value of each element of the myArr array to total.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Nesting For Loops </h2>
If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:<br>				

<pre>
var arr = [
  [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
];
for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (var j=0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
    console.log(arr[i][j]);
  }
}	
</pre>
This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note that for the inner loop, we are checking the .length of arr[i], since arr[i] is itself an array.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Modify function multiplyAll so that it multiplies the product variable by each number in the sub-arrays of arr<br>					
</p>
<hr>
<p>
	<h2>Iterate with JavaScript While Loops </h2>
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.<br>				

Another type of JavaScript loop is called a "while loop", because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.<br>				

<pre>
var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}	
</pre>
Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Push the numbers 0 through 4 to myArray using a while loop.<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Profile Lookup </h2>
We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.<br>				

A lookUpProfile function that takes firstName and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.<br>				

The function should check if firstName is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.<br>				

If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.<br>				

If firstName does not correspond to any contacts then return "No such contact"<br>				

If prop does not correspond to any valid properties then return "No such property"	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript </h2>
Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.<br>				

JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and not quite up to 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never quite return a 1<br>				

Note<br>				
Like Storing Values with the Equal Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Change randomFraction to return a random number instead of returning 0.<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript </h2>
It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.<br>				

Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.<br>				
Multiply that random decimal by 20.<br>				
Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.<br>				
Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.<br>				

Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:<br>				

Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);<br>				

We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Use this technique to generate and return a random whole number between 0 and 9.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range </h2>
Instead of generating a random number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.<br>				

To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.<br>				

Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:<br>				

Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Sift through Text with Regular Expressions </h2>
Regular expressions are used to find certain words or patterns inside of strings.<br>				

For example, if we wanted to find the word the in the string The dog chased the cat, we could use the following regular expression: /the/gi<br>				

Let's break this down a bit:<br>				

/ is the start of the regular expression.<br>				

the is the pattern we want to match.<br>				

/ is the end of the regular expression.<br>				

g means global, which causes the pattern to return all matches in the string, not just the first one.<br>				

i means that we want to ignore the case (uppercase or lowercase) when searching for the pattern.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Select all the occurrences of the word and in testString.<br>				

You can do this by replacing the . part of the regular expression with the word and.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Find Numbers with Regular Expressions </h2>
We can use special selectors in Regular Expressions to select a particular type of value.<br>				

One such selector is the digit selector \d which is used to retrieve one digit (e.g. numbers 0 to 9) in a string.<br>				

In JavaScript, it is used like this: /\d/g.<br>				

Appending a plus sign (+) after the selector, e.g. /\d+/g, allows this regular expression to match one or more digits.<br>				

The trailing g is short for 'global', which allows this regular expression to find all matches rather than stop at the first match.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Use the \d selector to select the number of numbers in the string, allowing for the possibility of one or more digit.	<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Find Whitespace with Regular Expressions </h2>
We can also use regular expression selectors like \s to find whitespace in a string.<br>				

The whitespace characters are " " (space), \r (the carriage return), \n (newline), \t (tab), and \f (the form feed).<br>				

The whitespace regular expression looks like this:<br>				

/\s+/g<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Use \s to select all the whitespace characters in the sentence string.<br>				
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Invert Regular Expression Matches with JavaScript </h2>
You can invert any match by using the uppercase version of the regular expression selector.<br>				

For example, \s will match any whitespace, and \S will match anything that isn't whitespace.<br>				

Instructions<br>				
Use /\S/g to count the number of non-whitespace characters in testString.	<br>
